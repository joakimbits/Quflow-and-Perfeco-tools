<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The following tutorial leads the user through the creation of
<strong>disipyl</strong> plots using the interactive Python interpreter.  I
also provide some longer examples in which I show the user how to derive
specialized classes and functions to suit particular plotting needs.</p>

<p>You may find it useful to open another browser window with the
auto-generated documentation.  Doing so will help you gain familiarity with
the function and classes which make up <strong>disipyl</strong>.</p>

<p>The tutorial assumes you've already installed <strong>disipyl</strong>
(and DISLIN) somewhere where the Python interpretter can find it (see the
section on installation for more details).  I also assume the modules
<code>Numeric</code> and <code>RandomArray</code> (both part of the NumPy
package) are available</p>

<h4>Conventions</h4>

<p>Throughout the tutorial we'll be creating and manipulating
<strong>disipyl</strong> objects both from the Python interactive
interpretter and in module files.  Both interactive sessions and module code
will be setoff with grey boxes in a fixed font (assuming your browser
supports CSS). Interactive sessions will be distinguished from module code by
the presence of the interpretter prompt symbol
(<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>For example, the following indicates an interactive session (the lines
without the prompts show what values [if any] the interpetter returns).</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; print "hello, python world!"
hello, python world!
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>

<p>This example shows a hypothetical function and class in a module:</p>
<pre class="code">## test.py

def helloFunction(name):
    print "Hello %s, it's nice to meet you!" % name
    

class AClass:
    def __init__(self):
        print "AClass created"
        
    def __del__(self):
        print "AClass destroyed"</pre>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Fire up the Python interpretter (see the documentation which came with you
Python distribution if you don't know how to do that).</p>

<p>We'll check that everything is ready to go by running some demos. Type the
following:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; from disipyl import demos
&gt;&gt;&gt; demos.showdemos()</pre>

<p>A series of example plots will begin to appear. After each plot appears
the program will wait until you hit the return key or click on the plot
window with your right-mouse button before continuing.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
Note: If you get an error message than disipyl hasn't been installed
correctly.  See <a href="installation.html" class="sidebar">Installation</a>
for more info.</div>

<p>To see a similar set of demos using the Tkinter GUI, type the following at
the command-line from within the the <strong>disipyl</strong> directory (this
assumes that the python interpretter is in your path):</p>
<pre class="code">$ python tkdisipyl.py</pre>

<p>A small window with two buttons will appear, offering you a choice between
the 2D and 3D demos.  You can play around with both sets of demos.  The 3D
demos are particularly interesting because they provide a set of navigation
buttons (e.g., rotate left, zoom in, etc.) so you can interactively explore
the 3D plots.</p>

<h2>Creating Plots</h2>

<h3>The Parts of a Plot</h3>

<p>Every valid drawing in <strong>disipyl</strong> consists of at least one
instance of each of the following classes (or their descendants):</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>Canvas</code></li>
  <li><code>PlotObject</code></li>
  <li><code>AxisSystem</code></li>
</ol>

<p>All three of these classes are primarily container classes - they maintain
a list of the subobjects which they are responsible for, and call each of
these subojects to draw themselves in turn.  For example, a
<code>PlotObject</code> instance must be assigned a valid
<code>AxisSystem</code> (in the <code>.axes</code> attribute).  Similarly an
<code>AxisSystem</code> should have two or more <code>Axis</code> objects
(<code>.xaxis</code>, <code>.yaxis</code>, and sometimes a
<code>.zaxis</code>).</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<strong>Note:</strong> If a PlotObject finds that it hasn't been assigned to
a Canvas it will generate its own Canvas instance in order to draw
itself.</div>

<p></p>

<p>All <code>disipyl</code> objects are ultimately derived from the
<code>Object</code> class, defined in the file <code>pxdislin.py</code>.  All
classes derived from <code>Object</code> maintain a private attribute
(currently a list) called <code>__options__</code> which is used to track and
maintain the different types of options which affect how the object is drawn.
This dictionary of options is accessed in a somewhat roundabout way - options
are set using the __call__ method of the class, options are retrieved using
the standard <code>__getattr__</code> function. We can examine all the
options of an object by using the __call__ method without any argument.  To
see how this works in action examine the following code:</p>

<p></p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; from disipyl import pxdislin
&gt;&gt;&gt; message = pxdislin.Text(text='hello, disipyl world!')
&gt;&gt;&gt; message()

*BEGIN OBJECT: Text
  TeX = 0
  color = fore
  font = default
  fonttype = hardware
  height = 36
  justify = left
  position = (0, 0)
  rotation = 0
  text = 'hello, disipyl world!'
  ucoords = 1
*END OBJECT: Text

&gt;&gt;&gt; message(color = 'red', height = 48)
&gt;&gt;&gt; message.color
'red'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>

<p>After importing the appropriate module, we created a <code>Text</code>
object to which we gave the name <code>message</code>.  We then invoked the
<code>__call__ </code>method (<code>message()</code>) without any arguments,
which returned a printed message showing the various options for this object.
We invoked the <code>__call__</code> method a second time with keyword
arguments.  These keyword arguments corresponded to the options we wished to
set.  Finally, we examined a single option (<code>message.color</code>) using
the standard attribute calling mechanism.</p>

<p>Note, that options can be set using either the normal attribute calling
mechanism (<code>.attribute</code>) or via the <code>__call__</code> method,
but you should always prefer the <code>__call__</code> method because only
then can <strong>disipyl</strong> ensure that the options you are setting are
relevant for the given object.</p>

<h3>Simple Plot Creation</h3>

<p>The first plot we will create will be a simple scatter plot.  The module,
<code>disipyl.plots</code>, provides a class, <code>ScatterPlot</code>, which
provides reasonable default values for scatter plots.  Once we've created our
plot, it's easy to refine it to get it <em>just right</em>.</p>

<p>Let's create the scatter plot:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; from disipyl import plots
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = plots.ScatterPlot(range(10),range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.draw()</pre>

<p>After importing the plots module we created a ScatterPlot object to which
we assigned the variable name 's' (when working in the interactive
interpretter it's most convenient to use short variable names; when creating
module files you should use more descriptive names).</p>

<p>The plot we've just created isn't very exciting.  It's a simple scatter
plot where the x- and y-values are identical.  We're going to spice up the
plot, but first let's explore the plot object a little:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; s()

*BEGIN OBJECT: ScatterPlot
  TeXmode = 1
  defaultcanvastype = disipyl.pxdislin.Canvas
  symbols = &lt;disipyl.pxdislin.SymbolGroup instance at 014197FC&gt;
*END OBJECT: ScatterPlot</pre>

<p>Any <strong>disipyl</strong> object derived from the base class
<code>Object</code> will display it's options when called without any
arguments.  The <code>ScatterPlot</code> has relatively few options of its
own.  The option <code>TeXmode</code> specifies whether TeX style formatting
of equations is available.  The option <code>defaultcanvastype</code>
specifies the type of Canvas object the plot should generate if it needs to
draw itself (as opposed to being draw as a sub-object of a Canvas).</p>

<p>When a <code>ScatterPlot</code> object is created the initial set of data
is represented by a <code>SymbolGroup</code> object.  A
<code>SymbolGroup</code> is simply a collection of individual
<code>Symbol</code> objects with similar options (color, shape, etc.).  The
reason that the <code>ScatterPlot</code> object has relatively few options is
that it is primarily a container object, as noted above.  When we call the
draw method for the <code>ScatterPlot</code> object it in turn invokes the
draw methods of each of it's sub-objects.</p>

<h4>Finding out about Object options</h4>

<p>What are the valid settings for the various options?  In version of
<strong>disipyl</strong> previous to 0.6 you just had to browse the source
code to find out.  In version 0.6 and higher there is a new method for
querying objects about their options.  This mechanism is accessed through the
<code>info()</code> method, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; s.info('TeXmode')
Specifies whether the TeX mode should be used for text objects.
Since this doesn't adversely affect anything else, it's probably
simplest to leave this on.
Valid: 0 (off) or 1 (on)
------- 
Default: 1

&gt;&gt;&gt; s.info('defaultcanvastype')
Specifies the default Canvas type (Canvas or its descendants)
which is created when a plot finds itself without a canvas object
to draw on.
Valid: Any object derived from Canvas
------- 
Default: Canvas

&gt;&gt;&gt; s.info('symbols')
Undocumented option.
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.info('foo')
No such option for ScatterPlot</pre>

<p>As you can see, the argument to the <code>info()</code> method is a string
with the name of the option you want to know more about.  If the option is
currently undocumented, then you are informed of this and you'll have to
browse into the source code to figure out what the option does (if it's not
obvious from the name).  Eventually I hope to have all the options will be
documented.</p>

<p>If you're creating new <strong>disipyl</strong> classes youreself you can
specify a file which holds the option documentation by specifying the
<code>INFOMODULE</code> attribute in a call to <code>setoptions</code>.  For
example, in the file <code>pxdislin</code> the <code>setdefaults</code>
method of the <code>Page</code> object  is defined as so:</p>
<pre class="code"># snippet from pxdislin.py
# from defintion of class Page

    def set_defaults(self):
        self.setoptions(
            fillcolor = None,
            border = 0,
            width = 3000,
            height = 2200,
            scale = 1,
            scalingmode = 'down',
            INFOMODULE = "optioninfo.page",
        )</pre>

<p>The <code>INFOMODULE</code> attribute points to a Python module
<code>optioninfo.page</code> (the file <code>page.py</code> in the
subdirectory <code>optioninfo</code>).  Simply change this value to an
appropriate value for your new class.</p>

<h4>Jazzing up the Plot</h4>

<p>Now we're ready to add some pizzaz to this plot.</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; s.symbols(color='red', size=35, shape='fill triangle')
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.axes.xaxis(name='X-Axis', nameheight=40)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.axes.yaxis(name='Y-Axis', nameheight=40)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.draw()</pre>

<p>This code changes the color, size and shape of the symbols used to
represent the scatter of the data, and adds some axis labels.</p>

<p>What if we want to then add some more data to the plot?  For example, we
might want to add some more symbols representing another set of observations.
This is relatively easy to do:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; group2 = pxdislin.SymbolGroup(range(10),range(9,-1,-1),color='blue', shape='fill circle',size=35)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.add(group2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.draw()</pre>

<p>Finally, we'll center and square-up the graph so that the units are the
same length in the x- and y-directions.  We'll also add a title:</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; s.axes(squared=1,centered=1,grids=1,ngridlines=(2,2))
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.title = pxdislin.Title(text="A Simple Graph",offset=-200)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.draw()</pre>

<h4>Interacting with a Plot</h4>

<p><strong>disipyl</strong> 0.6 introduces a new mechanism by which you can
interact with a 2D plot - the <code>explore()</code> method.  When you use
the <code>explore()</code> method with an instance of any class derived from
<code>PlotObject</code> you can click on the plot with mouse button one, and
the plot coordinates will be recorded.  Click mouse button two to stop
recording. After the plot exits the x- and y-coordinates which you clicked
will be returned as a tuple containing two lists.  Here's an example (in
which I clicked the plot three times)::</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; s = plots.ScatterPlot(range(10), range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.explore()
([1.2486993823422159, 3.4129315248323104, 5.5969735725168217], [2.2377216588389341, 4.4729876516275269, 7.018894839788552])
</pre>

<p>Currently the possibilties of plot interaction are very basic, but I will
include derived clases with more functionality in future releases (and you
can write such classes yourself - see the source code for
<code>PlotObject.draw()</code> and <code>PlotObject.explore()</code> in
<code>pxdislin.py</code> and the  function <code>getMouseClicks</code> in
<code>pydislin.py</code>)</p>

<h3>Creating a 3D Plot</h3>

<p>We're now going to use disipyl to create a 3-D plot of the function:
<em>f(x,y) = Imag(Log(x+iy))</em>.  There's two ways to do this - the easy
way and the hard way.  We'll start with the easy way, to show you just how
quickly one can create a plot in disipyl.  Then for completeness we'll do it
the hard way.</p>

<h4>The easy way</h4>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; import cmath 
&gt;&gt;&gt; from disipyl import plots
&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(x,y): 
        if x==0 and y==0:
            return 0
        z = cmath.log(complex(x,y)) 
        return z.imag
 
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy = plots.SurfacePlot(func,-2,2,0.5,-2,2,0.5) # set function to plot and axis limits
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy.axes(lengths3D=(2,2,1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy.surface(topcolor=50,bottomcolor=200)
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy.title = pxdislin.Title(text="$f(x,y)=Im(\log(x+iy))$") 
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy.draw()</pre>
Most of the above is self-explanatory.  The only additional operations
performed after creating the plot were to change the relative scaling by
which each of the axes is draw (by setting the <code>lengths3D</code>
option),  to set the colors used to draw the top and bottom of the surface
object, and to create a title.

<div class="sidebar">
<strong>Note:</strong> You can use standard TeX commands for formatting
formulas.</div>

<h4>The hard way</h4>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; hard = plots.Plot3D()
&gt;&gt;&gt; surface = pxdislin3D.FunctionSurface(func, 0.3,0.3,3,3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; surface(topcolor=50,bottomcolor=200)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hard.add(surface)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hard.axes.limits(-2,2,-2,2,-3,3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hard.axes(lengths3D=(2,2,1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; hard.title = pxdislin.Title(text="$f(x,y)=Im(\log(x+iy))$")
&gt;&gt;&gt; hard.draw()</pre>

<p>As you can see, the "hard way" isn't all that hard.  The only real
difference is that we had to create our own <code>FunctionSurface</code>
object (in the easy example the <code>SurfacePlot</code> object created it
for you), and we had to set our own axis limits..</p>

<p>If you are using the IDLE development environment you can use the
<code>Diddle</code> classes in <code>tkdisipyl.py</code> to interactively
explore your plot.</p>
<pre class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt; from disipyl import tkdisipyl
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = tkdisipyl.Diddle(hard)</pre>

<p>When you create a <code>Diddle</code> object a Tk window should pop up
containing the plot and a number of navigation buttons.  Try rotating,
tilting and zooming in on the plot.</p>

<h2>Creating a New Plot Class</h2>

<p>The <code>dispyl</code> package comes with a fairly good variety of
"pre-canned" plot types.  However, sooner or later you'll want to make a
specialized plot for which none of the supplied classes is appropriate.  In
such cases it's desirable to derive your own specialized plot class.</p>

<p>Most specialized plots can be derived from either the <code>Plot2D</code>
or <code>Plot3D</code> classes.  If you have very specialized needs you may
need to derive your class from the <code>PlotObject</code>.  The files
<code>plots.py</code> and <code>mlabplots.py</code> are filled with examples
of specialized plot classes.</p>

<h2>For More Information</h2>

<p>If you want to learn more about how to create disipyl plots, check out the
demo plots in <code>demos.py</code>.  I'll also try and add more examples to
this tutorial as development continues, so please check the disipyl website
for updates.</p>
