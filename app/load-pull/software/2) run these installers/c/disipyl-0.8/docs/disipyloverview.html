<h2>Description</h2>

<p><strong>disipyl</strong> is an object-oriented wrapper around
the DISLIN plotting library. <strong>disipyl</strong> provides a
set of classes which represent various aspects of DISLIN plots, as
well as providing some easy to use classes for creating commonly
used plot formats (e.g. scatter plots, histograms, 3-D surface
plots). A major goal in designing the library was to facilitate
interactive data exploration and plot creation.</p>

<p>A longer list of the feature provided by <strong>disipyl</strong> can be found <a href="disipylFeatures.html">here</a>.

<h3>What's DISLIN?</h3>

<p>DISLIN is a powerful and flexible multiplatform (Win32, Unix,
Linux, etc.) programming library designed for displaying scientific
data. DISLIN's author, Helmut Michels, has made available a free
DISLIN plotting extension for the Python programming language (see
the <a href="http://www.linmpi.mpg.de/dislin">DISLIN</a> homepage
for more details).</p>

<p>The default Python interface provided with DISLIN is very terse,
and essentially mirrors it's C and Fortran interfaces. To create a
complex plot the user must make a series of function calls in just
the right order. Despite it's terseness, when employed
effectively, DISLIN can churn out detailed, publication
quality plots. <strong>disipyl</strong> makes it easy to do so!</p>

<h3>What's Included?</h3>

<p>In addition to the wrapper classes and functions,
<strong>disipyl</strong> includes a variety of "extensions":</p>

<ul>
<li>Two demo programs: 

<ul>
<li>Non-interactive demo -- a slide show of example plots.</li>

<li>Interactive Tkinter-base demo (including a demonstration of a
3D plot explorer).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Classes for working with Tkinter (the default Python GUI)</li>

<li>A module of MATLAB like plotting functions.</li>

<li>The zipfile, for Win32 systems, includes the dislin.dll so you can get started
right away. For other platforms you'll need to download the correct
package from the <a href="http://www.linmpi.mpg.de/dislin">DISLIN
homepage</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>History</h2>

<p><strong>disipyl</strong> descends from pxDislin, a previous
wrapper-library I designed. <strong>disipyl</strong> shares much in
common with pxDislin but represents a complete rewrite.
<strong>disipyl</strong> presents a <em>much</em> cleaner
interface, and is easier to maintain and extend. By starting "from
scratch" I was able to keep the things I liked about pxDislin while
ridding myself of the extra baggage that had accumulated around my
earlier design.</p>

<p>The library has been tested on WinNT and FreeBSD, but I
anticipate that it should work on any platform which can make use
of Python, Numpy, and the DISLIN python extensions.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This is the first public release of <strong>disipyl</strong>,
and as such it should be regarded as "beta" quality code. I've
spent a lot of time using the library myself, and I've tried to
create demos and test code which puts the library through its
paces. Nevertheless, there are bound to be bugs. I'm interested in
<em>quickly</em> squashing those bugs and moving rapidly towards a
stable 1.0 release. In order to do this I will need lots of
feedback from users. <em>Please</em> make sure to submit any and
all bug reports. I am shooting for a turn around of less than 24
hours for fixes on bug reports submitted with example code.</p>

<p>I believe the interface is pretty much stable. There maybe a few
tweaks and fiddlings here and there, but barring any major
complaints from users, all the base classes should be pretty close
to done.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>A few classes could use some more attention (e.g. PieChart), and
a small number of DISLIN features that I've never used (e.g., map
plots) need to be wrapped. It would also be useful to improve the
error checking.</p>
